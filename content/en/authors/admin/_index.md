## About Me

I am someone who values learning, growth, and meaningful connections with others. My professional journey has taken me through IT, customer service, quality assurance, sales, procurement, human resources, and other fields, each teaching me valuable lessons about people, collaboration, and problem-solving.

I strive to approach life with curiosity, kindness, and integrity, seeking to bring compassion and fairness into everything I do. I try to stay connected to the positive qualities of my “inner child” - creativity, wonder, and joy - believing that small acts of care and respect can make the world a little brighter.

Above all, my goal is to use what I learn to support others, contribute positively to my community, and continue becoming a better version of myself - one step at a time.
