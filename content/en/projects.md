      title: Why Am I Offering Services?
      text: I enjoy helping others with the skills I've gained over the years. **Here’s a selection of services I can provide if you're interested.** You might wonder why I'm pursuing this path, especially when you look at my resume. **I’m excited to explore new opportunities to leverage my skills in ways that make a real difference for others.** While I’m open to corporate positions, I want to uncover my "superpower" — that one service through which I can significantly impact lives while earning a living. **My goal is to use my knowledge and experience to benefit others on a personal level**, with the hope of building something larger in the future. Although I'm uncertain where this journey will lead, as the saying goes, "No wind is favorable to those who do not have a destination." I feel compelled to try something, focusing on what I am passionate about and skilled in, even without launching a company. Recently, I came across **inspiring advice from Rory Vaden "You are most powerfully positioned to serve the person you once were."** This resonates deeply with me, as I believe no one is more credible than someone who has gone through similar experiences. I'm committed to finding my "superpower" and embracing the journey ahead.
