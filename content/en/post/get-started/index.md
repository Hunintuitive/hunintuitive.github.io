## ðŸŽ¶ A Dive Into My Musical World

![ME](/en/post/get-started/break.png)

Hello, dear reader!ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This was my very first blog post - and as I plan to update it from time to time, sharing my passions, discoveries, and stories, this is the latest version of it.

> ***In a very real sense, we are aliens on a strange planet. We spend most of our lives reaching out and trying to communicate. If during our whole lifetime, we could reach out and really connect with just two people, we are indeed very fortunate." -Gene Roddenberry***

Music, for me, is the heartbeat of life - a profound love that resonates deep within my soul. Whether Iâ€™m lost in enchanting melodies, creating my own tunes with joy, or dancing freely to rhythmic beats, music enriches every moment. Music is one powerful driver of the prosperity of all mankind.

As a devoted "Trekkie", I find endless inspiration in the vast universe of Star Trek and sci-fi. The stories of exploration, unity, and hope fuel my imagination and remind me of the importance of curiosity and open-mindedness in our own world.

Spock from *Star Trek* used to say: ðŸ–– *Live long and prosper!* ðŸ˜Š That is my honest wish for you and all of us!

## The Enchanting Pulse: Exploring the Mesmerizing World of Trance Music

Trance music is more than just a genre for me; itâ€™s a journey into the depths of sound and emotion. With its mesmerizing rhythms and ethereal melodies, trance invites listeners to surrender and lose themselves in a state of euphoria and introspection. Itâ€™s a sonic landscape where time dissolves, and the mind can wander freely, guided by captivating beats and uplifting harmonies. Whether experienced in a vibrant festival or through a solitary moment of reflection, trance music has the power to transform, inspire, and connect us to a higher state of consciousness.

### Harmonizing Hearts: EduTryâ€™s Fusion of Trance and Classical Music

Imagine a seamless fusion of tranceâ€™s enchanting pulse with the timeless elegance of classical melodies, a musical tapestry where hearts are touched and spirits lifted. EduTry, the talented artist from Madrid, masterfully weaves heartfelt melodies with electronic elements, creating a sonic landscape that invites listeners to embark on an emotional journey. His blending of trance and classical music evokes a sense of wonder, as soaring strings intertwine with pulsating beats, crafting a rich, immersive world of sound. Every track feels like a heartfelt message, a moment of connection designed to resonate deeply within the soul.

Drawing inspiration from the legendary band Hybrid of the 80s, whose innovative approach to blending genres opened new dimensions in electronic music, EduTryâ€™s work echoes that same spirit of experimentation and emotional depth. Like the lush, layered soundscapes of Hybrid, his music transports me every time-allowing me to get lost in its vibrant world of beats and emotions. Itâ€™s a place where time stands still, and I can fully immerse myself in the richness of the sound, feeling every note resonate within.

## Synthwave & Retrowave: A Love Letter to â€˜80s Nostalgia

Synthwave and retrowave are vibrant genres rooted in the nostalgic celebration of the 1980s, blending retro-futuristic aesthetics with modern electronic production. Characterized by lush synthesizers, pulsating basslines, and nostalgic melodies, these genres evoke the spirit of classic movies, video games, and neon-lit cityscapes from the era.

Artists like Nina and The Midnight have become prominent voices within this scene, seamlessly merging cinematic soundscapes with heartfelt songwriting. Nina, known for her dreamy vocals and evocative melodies, captures the emotional depth of retrowave, while The Midnight combines nostalgic synths with poetic lyrics, creating immersive musical journeys. Their work exemplifies how synthwave and retrowave are more than just genres - they're a passionate love letter to a bygone era, reimagined for modern audiences.

As a kid of the 80s, I can't help but find this music incredibly inspiring. It often transports me back in time, allowing me to relive joyful childhood memories. That era was a period of musical innovation and bold experimentation, with a rich diversity of genres being created. The vibrant sounds of the 80s -ranging from synth-pop and new wave to early hip-hop and many others- defined a dynamic era of creativity that continues to inspire and resonate with me and others as well today.
