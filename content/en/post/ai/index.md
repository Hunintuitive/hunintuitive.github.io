**This article was initially inspired by my struggle to search for an appropriate job, just to find out how detrimental the use of AI in some cases can be. The use of AI algorithms in ATS systems is not so beneficial as some may think. I have also included some interesting links from YouTube on the subject of AI and ATS systems. Have fun reading!**

## The race for AI, demanding from humans to act like machines

# Is AI everything you should aim for? How does it impact our lives? Do we have to behave like machines? A tech enthusiast's thoughts on AI and its implications on our very lives.


## @ The Switch (2010 Movie):

***"Look at us! Running around, always rushed, always late. I guess that's why they call it the "human" "race". What we crave most in this world is connection..."***

So what do you think? Could there be some truth in the opening lines of that movie?

What for can be AI relevant? For the human race or just for the sake of a random pointless "race"?

Not at all an easy question. It made me think about this, that is what inspired this article. I am not wanting to really influence you in either direction. I just want to point out some things about it using sound mind judgment and involving some of the thoughts and opinions of other brilliant and more educated people than me on these topics which captivated my attention.

## What is more important for us humans?

I tend to agree on the viewpoint that for us humans, and for the human race what is ultimately an important goal, or call it maybe a "need" in life, aside from earning a living, wanting to have peace and the options to live a per se "good" life, is that **in a meaningful way we do crave to connect with our environment**, be it nature, people around us or even higher forces like God, alien cultures and so on... Pick whichever fuels your imagination or is important to you.

## How AI impacts our lives?

In the ever-evolving technological landscape, the race for artificial intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic of conversation. As machines become more "intelligent" and capable of performing a wide range of tasks, the pressure on humans to adapt and act more like machines is increasing, and that may not be a good thing. The problem might be of course our own view of things, the ways we respond to technological advancements or the way we use them and relate to them in everyday life.

AI is revolutionizing industries from healthcare to finance, and its potential to streamline processes and increase efficiency is undeniable. However, as machines become more advanced, the demand for humans to act like machines is growing as well.

Did you know, that if you apply for a job on a career site, so called ATS (meaning Applicant Tracking System) systems, which can incorporate AI solutions could decide the fate of your CV being even considered or passed on to a human recruiter? Aside from some valid reasons pointed out by the companies applying these tools, how does this make you feel? 

If you have no clue that you will be evaluated by an algorithm, or do not know how to compose a CV that will pass the test of the AI, what benefit will it bring to you or to the company using it? - arises the hopefully logical question in my mind. There will be a reduction in recruiters needing to read through thousands of resumes for sure, but will it really benefit the company, will it ensure to get the best candidates suited for the job? I leave it to you, to decide.

It was funny that I applied to many jobs recently, only to be rejected by the algorithms, and surprisingly, for being contacted later by some recruiters from the same company. They saw my LinkedIn profile online, and offered a similar job as the one I applied to and got rejected in the first attempt on the company career site which uses these AI algorithms. 

What do you think? Was the use of AI in this case beneficial or rather the opposite?

## Does it seem that we are lured into wanting to behave like our own creation? Does this benefit us?

In a world where speed and accuracy are key, humans are being **pushed** to perform tasks with machine-like precision. In industries such as manufacturing and logistics, the ability to work quickly and without error is essential to staying competitive. Even in customer service there is an ever increasing demand to be quick, be able to use multiple tools at once and be able to maximize multitasking in shortest amount of time possible. This has led to a shift in the way humans approach their work, with a focus on efficiency and productivity above all else. We expect that every service, every device, even our fellow human beings perform perfectly all the time and in every possible circumstance. The only problem with this expectation is only, that it is not at all realistic.

It reminds me of a famous quote from Esther Perel: "Expectations are resentment in the making". Yes, if expectations are not realistic, or we put too much emphasis on them, we can create more negative outcomes than we would like.

Acting like a machine is not without its challenges. Humans are emotional beings, and trying to suppress those emotions in favor of a more robotic approach can be difficult. Studies have shown that burnout and mental health issues are on the rise in industries that place a heavy emphasis on productivity and efficiency. Some scientists are claiming that there is no human really capable or multitasking, at least for sure not as efficiently as a multicore CPU is capable in doing so in a computer. Fun fact: Did you know that computers were originally people at NASA using math to aid the calculations for space exploration? Yet there is a growing expectancy for us to excel in multitasking, whatever this should mean.

Furthermore, the pressure to act like machines can have negative effects on creativity and innovation. Machines may be able to perform tasks quickly and accurately, but they lack the ability to think outside the box and come up with new ideas. As humans are pushed to focus solely on efficiency, the risk of stifling creativity becomes more pronounced.

## What about some conclusions on all this?

So, where do we go from here? It is clear that AI is here to stay and will continue to play a significant role in shaping the future of work and even other aspects of life. However, it is important for humans to remember that they are not machines and it should not be expected from anyone to act like them. And by that I mean that us humans should shape our expectations accordingly to the fact, that no fellow human will be really able to perform as a machine does. 

Finding a balance between efficiency and creativity is crucial in a world where AI is increasingly integrated into our daily lives. Embracing the benefits of AI while also acknowledging and leveraging the unique strengths of human intelligence will be key to navigating the race for AI in a way that is sustainable and rewarding for the human race.

As a creation of humans I left AI out of the equation above on purpose.

Some might think of AI and machines as the next step of human evolution, the way we will evolve in the future. But is this the only way? And is it a good one?

And while there is some sense of beauty in machines created by us, even more so in every aspect of life around us, and if you will, we humans, are one example of an extraordinary creation, a biological "machine" which is, at least now more precious and wonderful as a machine or "intelligence" created by us, even if in some ways it is faster in making some decisions and in some instances it outperforms us.

I tend to believe that we are not an accident of nature. All life on planet Earth seems to be composed of tiny biological 'machines' with sophisticated 'hardware,' such as proteins, DNA, earth minerals, and compounds, and 'software,' referring to the vast information encoded in the DNA of all living things. This information forms larger systems, ranging from bacteria to the largest creatures on our planet. Whether one calls it God or an alien race, the intelligence behind this phenomenon must be profound and deserving of more research on our side. Compared to all this, AI is a great achievement, but not the most significant.

We barely understand ourselves and our environment, and already want to create something new and act like this is our future and most important for us? This is a hard question, isn't it?

AI is not good or bad. What matters is how we use it and how we behave in relation to it.

## A little experiment: I asked Chat GPT if AI was sentient or comparable to human intelligence.

The answer was not at all surprising:

"As of now, AI is not sentient, nor is it comparable to human intelligence in the full sense. AI systems, including advanced models like GPT-3 and its successors, operate based on algorithms and data patterns rather than consciousness, self-awareness, or emotional understanding.

Sentience: Sentience refers to the capacity to have feelings, perceptions, and subjective experiences. Current AI lacks these attributes; it doesn't possess awareness or the ability to experience emotions. AI can simulate conversation and respond to queries but does not have desires, beliefs, or subjective experiences.
Human Intelligence: Human intelligence involves a wide range of cognitive abilities, including reasoning, problem-solving, emotional understanding, creativity, and social interaction. AI can excel in specific tasks and can outperform humans in certain areas (like data processing or pattern recognition). However, it does not possess the general intelligence that humans do, which encompasses emotional and social intelligence, ethical reasoning, and the ability to adapt to novel situations in a human-like way.

In summary, while AI can mimic aspects of human behavior and perform complex tasks, it lacks consciousness and the full breadth of human cognitive and emotional capabilities."

## Experiment continues - question towards AI: Does AI outperform humans? In what ways?

The Answer of AI was not surprising this time either:

AI can outperform humans in various tasks and domains, particularly in areas that require processing large volumes of data or performing repetitive tasks. Here are some ways in which AI demonstrates superior performance compared to humans:

Data Processing and Analysis: AI algorithms can analyze vast datasets quickly and accurately, identifying patterns and trends that would be time-consuming or impossible for humans to detect.
Speed and Efficiency: AI systems can perform calculations and tasks at speeds that far exceed human capabilities. This is particularly beneficial in fields like finance, where rapid decision-making is crucial.
Predictive Analytics: AI can make predictions based on historical data. In sectors like marketing, healthcare, and finance, predictive models can generate insights that help organizations make informed decisions.
Automation of Repetitive Tasks: AI can automate routine tasks such as data entry, scheduling, and inventory management, freeing up human workers to focus on more complex and creative tasks.
Precision and Accuracy: In fields such as medical imaging and manufacturing, AI can achieve higher levels of precision and consistency than humans, reducing the likelihood of errors.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI-powered language models can understand and generate human language, allowing them to assist in writing, translation, and customer service more efficiently than humans in some scenarios.
Image and Voice Recognition: AI systems can outperform humans in tasks involving image classification and voice recognition, making them valuable in applications ranging from security to accessibility.
Game Playing: In strategic games such as chess, Go, and video games, AI has demonstrated an ability to outperform top human players through advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques.
Personalization: AI can analyze user behavior and preferences to provide personalized recommendations in areas like e-commerce, streaming services, and advertising, often leading to higher customer satisfaction and engagement.

Again in summary while AI excels in these areas, it's essential to note that humans still possess unique qualities, such as emotional intelligence, creativity, and complex decision-making skills that AI cannot replicate. The most effective applications often involve collaboration between AI systems and human expertise.

## Final thoughts:

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the help of AI in many fields of application where it is a useful tool like medicine and many other fields of application since it "augments" some of our lacking abilities. I even used it as an aid to check this article. But as wonderful it is, as a creation of some ingenious human beings, I am reluctant to compare myself to their creation and try to compete with it, or want to ascend to something I am not, maybe never will be.

My two cents to all this are: AI is a wonderful helping tool which can be used wisely for good and very poorly even for damaging purposes. As a human I am trying to aim for perfection, but the truth is, that many of us, myself included, have no real clue what the term perfection should even mean or represent. It depends on who you ask, so that may not be such a reliable value as we might think of it. Sometimes we have to slow down and process the reality around us just as it is. With our own capabilities given after we were born. This is where AI may not be able to help us, nor direct us in the right direction.

I wonder if we'll ever get the point, like the ending lines of the movie pointed out so beautifully:

## @ The Switch (2010 Movie) Ending lines:

***"Look at us! Running around, always rushed, always late. I guess that's why they call it the human "race". But sometimes it slows down just enough for all the pieces to fall into place. Fate works it's magic. And you are connected. Every once in a while with all the randomness something unexpected happens and that pushes us all forward. And the truth is... what I'm starting to think..., what I'm starting to feel..., is that MAYBE, the human race isn't a "race" at all..."***
