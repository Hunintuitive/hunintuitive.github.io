## I understand that while it’s easy to say, “Just do it,” taking action can often feel overwhelming. I vividly recall my former self questioning, “Are you serious? How can I possibly tackle this? There’s so much information out there — how do I know what’s truly helpful for me? Isn’t it enough just to consult my doctors? I simply don’t have the time for this!”

The reality is that, yes, **you** can take charge of your health. **However, relying on the wrong information could lead you into serious trouble.** Ultimately, your health is **your** responsibility; no one else will take ownership of it.


## You might be surprised to learn that this was me back in the spring of 2020: humble beginnings, indeed…

## This situation transformed over time. Here I am in September 2022:

## After getting accustomed to my former self from 2020, would you have recognized me in 2022 as I walked by wearing those sunglasses?

To put this into perspective, I found myself in a difficult situation at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Weighing 107 kg, I faced numerous health challenges. I felt miserable, struggled with brain fog, dealt with hypertension, and suffered from a complicated “aura” type of migraine that mimicked stroke symptoms. Additionally, I battled depression and was likely insulin resistant — which indicated I was on the verge of becoming prediabetic. Despite adhering to mainstream dietary advice and relying on the food pyramid, I believed I was making healthier choices. I even purchased a rowing machine to exercise, yet, instead of improvements, my condition only worsened — I became more obese despite trying to eat less.

# The Power of Knowledge

However, the pandemic and the subsequent quarantine presented me with an unexpected opportunity. Being confined at home afforded me time for self-reflection and research. As I explored the internet to make the most of this time, I unearthed various topics of interest. Then, in late 2021, I stumbled upon a video on Dr. Sten Eckberg’s YouTube channel. That moment truly altered the course of my life.

## It was this video that struck a chord and set me on a transformative journey:

What??? Really? Doctors can be wrong about many aspects of our health? As I discovered during my journey toward health consciousness, this is unfortunately not just a myth. I’ve learned that I cannot blindly trust any health professional simply because they attended medical school and hold a PhD. It’s important to approach health advice critically and seek out multiple perspectives.

# The Reality of Health Education


I’m not suggesting that all doctors are unreliable or that we should solely depend on our “gut feelings” regarding health. Instead, it is unfortunate that many people are uninformed about health and nutrition, and it often takes a severe health scare for us to take our conditions seriously — conditions that are ultimately a result of our own lifestyle choices. Ignorance on this topic is not really an option.


Fortunately, many general practitioners, medical doctors, and scientists are willing to challenge outdated paradigms once they recognize what I also noticed: ultimately, only the results — driven by data— will indicate whether we are effectively managing the conditions that develop over time.

**Here are some individuals whose work I’ve studied through their books and videos:**
  - **Dr. Sten Eckberg - Olympic Decathlete and Holistic Doctor**
  - **Dr. Stephen Phinney - Physician-Scientist**
  - **Dr. Eric Berg - Board-Certified Chiropractor**
  - **Dr. Robert Lustig - Professor of Pediatric Endocrinology**
  - **Dr. Pradip Jamnadas - Cardiologist Founder and Medical Director of Cardiovascular Interventions**
  - **Dr. Paul Mason - Fellowship trained Sports and Exercise Medicine Physician with degrees in Medicine, Physiotherapy, and Occupational Health**
  - **Dr. Andrew Huberman - Ph.D., a Neuroscientist, Tenured professor in the Department of Neurobiology, and by courtesy, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford School of Medicine**
  - **Dr. Tim Spector - Professor of Genetic Epidemiology King’s College London, Scientific co-founder at ZOE**
  - **Dr. Chris Van Tulleken - Infection Doctor, Academic, BBC broadcaster, UNICEF supporter**
  - **Dr. Rena Malik - Board-certified urologist with specialized training in Female Pelvic Medicine, Reconstructive Surgery, and Sexual Medicine, as well as a certified Menopause Society Practitioner**
  - **Dr. Tara Swart - Neuroscientist, Medical Doctor**

I haven’t listed all of them, as there are many others, including several interviewed by **Steven Bartlett**, who graciously hosts the insightful podcast **The Diary of a CEO. A big thank you to Steven for that!** I wholeheartedly recommend this podcast to all; I can assure you it will not be time wasted. 

**I owe a great deal to the doctors mentioned above, for their guidance and advice have enabled me to transform my life for the better.**

It resonated deeply with me when Dr. Robert Lustig quoted in his book "Metabolical": "At UCSF we have a motto: 'In God we trust, everyone else has to produce the data.'" I wholeheartedly agree and have gladly adopted that as my personal motto as well.

## Here’s an example of such data, which reveals that many people have had experiences similar to mine: they follow what their doctor or dietitian recommends, and their condition continues to worsen:

I began to identify patterns everywhere that indicated that if we do not educate ourselves about health, we cannot claim to be wise. Eventually, we will “reap what we sow,” as mentioned in Galatians 6:7 (The Bible).

## There’s a saying: “If something seems too good to be true, assume that it isn’t.”
But why are we still so easily lured into believing fairy tales? Take the “magic pill” mentality, for example. Deep down, we likely know that there is no “magic pill” or single cure for all our problems, yet we still hope that somewhere, some brilliant inventor will eventually create it. This same notion applies to our expectations about relationships, wealth, and pretty much all aspects of life. However, the truth is that if you do not make an effort, if you do not search and put in the work, you will not “reap any benefits.”

Have you seen the documentary The Magic Pill? It’s a controversial piece that has drawn much criticism, but to me, it conveys significant truths beyond just its focus on ketosis and ketogenic diets, which many critics scrutinize. The documentary delves into fundamental truths about the Earth’s ecosystem and how it was originally designed (yes, I believe in a Great Designer who placed us here with a distinct purpose) and how humanity has disrupted this intricate system, jeopardizing both our health and our very existence.

{{< youtube W2mkTlTGM9c >}}

This documentary further illustrates that there is no magic pill. We cannot assume that we can reinvent our food or alter it without understanding the long-term effects, all the while expecting to succeed. This principle extends not only to food and health but also to how we treat our entire environment here on Earth.

Prof. Yuval Noah Harari (historian) shared a disturbing insight in a captivating podcast on The Diary of a CEO:
“***Humans typically learn to manipulate something long before they understand the consequences of their manipulations.*** If we examine the external world, particularly our ecological systems, we have learned how to cut down forests and build massive dams long before grasping their implications on those ecosystems, which has contributed to the current ecological crisis. We manipulated the world without understanding the consequences, and something similar could very well happen within our own bodies.” 


## How true this rings for our health!

# A Hopeful Transformation

But back to my story. After several years on this new journey of enlightening discovery, I have become much healthier: I’ve reversed my hypertension, insulin resistance, eliminated brain fog, and lost 35 kg of body weight over the span of 8 months. In fact, my weight loss journey is ongoing as I continue to learn about “how the body works,” to quote Dr. Eckberg. I now feel much better, as I understand how to utilize various simple tools to achieve the health outcomes I need.

# My Path to Change


## What events have led to the result in addition to the "work" invested?

I needed to hit rock bottom to catalyze my change. I needed that video from Dr. Eckberg, which struck a particular nerve and ignited my motivation for change. I had to realize that I could not alter my results if I continued the same behaviors that previously led to them, simply hoping for a positive outcome. ***Remember, there is no magic pill.***

I needed to educate myself extensively about the biochemistry of the body, nutrition, recent history, and how to differentiate between genuine science and pseudoscience. For instance, it is crucial to grasp the difference between “correlation” and “causation.” Investigate who funds the studies you rely on and consider their possible incentives. Making educated guesses about the ruth is far from impossible, right?

I had to distinguish between real food and items merely labeled “food.” As Dr. Lustig states in his book, ***“People think supplements are the antidote for bad food. They’re not. Rather, Real Food is the treatment, while bad food is the poison. Real Food is low in sugar and high in fiber, which lowers insulin levels; it protects the liver and nourishes the gut.”*** Real food typically has a short shelf life and rarely comes in a package with a label or nutrition facts.

Moreover, I needed to understand the significant impact of diets on our health. From my research — initially centered around Keto and Intermittent Fasting — I learned that different diets can serve as tools for specific outcomes. However, any diet can be harmful if it includes unhealthy, ultra-processed products that aren’t considered Real Food. Almost any type of diet can be healthy if it consists of Real Food. Conversely, it holds true that if you consume ultra-processed “food,” regardless of the diet it fits into, it will negatively affect your health.

## Just a little tip to make things easier:

If you focus solely on Real Food while practicing intermittent fasting (also known as time-restricted feeding) and occasionally engaging in longer fasts (to promote autophagy — a self-repair state of the body), you will likely experience improved health. This has been my most significant realization so far.

Of course, there are many more nuances to know about what counts as Real Food and what doesn’t, but I’ll write about that in a future article.

## The purpose of writing this article:

I chose to share my personal story and a glimpse of what I’ve recently discovered about health — specifically my health — to encourage **YOU**, the reader, to take this important matter into your own hands. I didn’t spend all my time learning about these topics over the last five years in one go; rather, I learned bit by bit, step by step. This is the approach you should adopt as well.

There are countless success stories around us, highlighting that those who achieved them did not succumb to the limiting beliefs that certain entities in this world attempt to impose upon them.

## May your journey become one such success story! I wish you all the best!
