      <title>Taking Charge of Your Health - My Journey from Struggles to Strength</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-understand-that-while-its-easy-to-say-just-do-it-taking-action-can-often-feel-overwhelming-i-vividly-recall-my-former-self-questioning-are-you-serious-how-can-i-possibly-tackle-this-theres-so-much-information-out-there---how-do-i-know-whats-truly-helpful-for-me-isnt-it-enough-just-to-consult-my-doctors-i-simply-dont-have-the-time-for-this&#34;&gt;I understand that while it’s easy to say, “Just do it,” taking action can often feel overwhelming. I vividly recall my former self questioning, “Are you serious? How can I possibly tackle this? There’s so much information out there - how do I know what’s truly helpful for me? Isn’t it enough just to consult my doctors? I simply don’t have the time for this!”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that, yes, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; can take charge of your health. &lt;strong&gt;However, relying on the wrong information could lead you into serious trouble.&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimately, your health is &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; responsibility; no one else will take ownership of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-might-be-surprised-to-learn-that-this-was-me-back-in-the-spring-of-2020-humble-beginnings-indeed&#34;&gt;You might be surprised to learn that this was me back in the spring of 2020: humble beginnings, indeed…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this into perspective, I found myself in a difficult situation at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Weighing 107 kg, I faced numerous health challenges. I felt miserable, struggled with brain fog, dealt with hypertension, and suffered from a complicated “aura” type of migraine that mimicked stroke symptoms. Additionally, I battled depression and was likely insulin resistant - which indicated I was on the verge of becoming prediabetic. Despite adhering to mainstream dietary advice and relying on the food pyramid, I believed I was making healthier choices. I even purchased a rowing machine to exercise, yet, instead of improvements, my condition only worsened - I became more obese despite trying to eat less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-power-of-knowledge&#34;&gt;The Power of Knowledge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the pandemic and the subsequent quarantine presented me with an unexpected opportunity. Being confined at home afforded me time for self-reflection and research. As I explored the internet to make the most of this time, I unearthed various topics of interest. Then, in late 2021, I stumbled upon a video on Dr. Sten Eckberg’s YouTube channel. That moment truly altered the course of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-was-this-video-that-struck-a-chord-and-set-me-on-a-transformative-journey&#34;&gt;It was this video that struck a chord and set me on a transformative journey:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What??? Really? Doctors can be wrong about many aspects of our health? As I discovered during my journey toward health consciousness, this is unfortunately not just a myth. I’ve learned that I cannot blindly trust any health professional simply because they attended medical school and hold a PhD. It’s important to approach health advice critically and seek out multiple perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-reality-of-health-education&#34;&gt;The Reality of Health Education&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting that all doctors are unreliable or that we should solely depend on our “gut feelings” regarding health. Instead, it is unfortunate that many people are uninformed about health and nutrition, and it often takes a severe health scare for us to take our conditions seriously - conditions that are ultimately a result of our own lifestyle choices. Ignorance on this topic is not really an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, many general practitioners, medical doctors, and scientists are willing to challenge outdated paradigms once they recognize what I also noticed: ultimately, only the results - driven by data- will indicate whether we are effectively managing the conditions that develop over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some individuals whose work I’ve studied through their books and videos:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Sten Eckberg - Olympic Decathlete and Holistic Doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Stephen Phinney - Physician-Scientist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Eric Berg - Board-Certified Chiropractor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Robert Lustig - Professor of Pediatric Endocrinology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Pradip Jamnadas - Cardiologist Founder and Medical Director of Cardiovascular Interventions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Paul Mason - Fellowship trained Sports and Exercise Medicine Physician with degrees in Medicine, Physiotherapy, and Occupational Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Andrew Huberman - Ph.D., a Neuroscientist, Tenured professor in the Department of Neurobiology, and by courtesy, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford School of Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Tim Spector - Professor of Genetic Epidemiology King’s College London, Scientific co-founder at ZOE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Chris Van Tulleken - Infection Doctor, Academic, BBC broadcaster, UNICEF supporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Rena Malik - Board-certified urologist with specialized training in Female Pelvic Medicine, Reconstructive Surgery, and Sexual Medicine, as well as a certified Menopause Society Practitioner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Tara Swart - Neuroscientist, Medical Doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t listed all of them, as there are many others, including several interviewed by &lt;strong&gt;Steven Bartlett&lt;/strong&gt;, who graciously hosts the insightful podcast &lt;strong&gt;The Diary of a CEO. A big thank you to Steven for that!&lt;/strong&gt; I wholeheartedly recommend this podcast to all; I can assure you it will not be time wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I owe a great deal to the doctors mentioned above, for their guidance and advice have enabled me to transform my life for the better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It resonated deeply with me when Dr. Robert Lustig quoted in his book &amp;ldquo;Metabolical&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;At UCSF we have a motto: &amp;lsquo;In God we trust, everyone else has to produce the data.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; I wholeheartedly agree and have gladly adopted that as my personal motto as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heres-an-example-of-such-data-which-reveals-that-many-people-have-had-experiences-similar-to-mine-they-follow-what-their-doctor-or-dietitian-recommends-and-their-condition-continues-to-worsen&#34;&gt;Here’s an example of such data, which reveals that many people have had experiences similar to mine: they follow what their doctor or dietitian recommends, and their condition continues to worsen:&lt;/h2&gt;

        wrapper.appendChild(iframe);
      });
    });

&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I began to identify patterns everywhere that indicated that if we do not educate ourselves about health, we cannot claim to be wise. Eventually, we will “reap what we sow,” as mentioned in Galatians 6:7 (The Bible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theres-a-saying-if-something-seems-too-good-to-be-true-assume-that-it-isnt&#34;&gt;There’s a saying: “If something seems too good to be true, assume that it isn’t.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why are we still so easily lured into believing fairy tales? Take the “magic pill” mentality, for example. Deep down, we likely know that there is no “magic pill” or single cure for all our problems, yet we still hope that somewhere, some brilliant inventor will eventually create it. This same notion applies to our expectations about relationships, wealth, and pretty much all aspects of life. However, the truth is that if you do not make an effort, if you do not search and put in the work, you will not “reap any benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the documentary The Magic Pill? It’s a controversial piece that has drawn much criticism, but to me, it conveys significant truths beyond just its focus on ketosis and ketogenic diets, which many critics scrutinize. The documentary delves into fundamental truths about the Earth’s ecosystem and how it was originally designed (yes, I believe in a Great Designer who placed us here with a distinct purpose) and how humanity has disrupted this intricate system, jeopardizing both our health and our very existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This documentary is very valuable in my eyes. Not only because it reveals truths that many people feel uncomfortable with, but also because it teaches us about good nutrition. Not just because it challenges the status quo, but because it conveys a holistic approach based on verifiable facts, if one is impartial enough to approach the research with curiosity and impartiality. It also shows how the basic processes that sustain life in both the plant and animal kingdoms work, and shows that even well-intentioned, honest individuals can be misled if they do not seek to verify the information they accept. Anyone who merely argues about whether the keto diet is good is, in my humble opinion, prone to rely on their own biases and not trying to look at the whole, bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was intrigued by some of Nora Gedgaudas&amp;rsquo; (author/nutritional therapist) comments and arguments, which I would like to quote:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a single multinational corporation on planet Earth that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stand to profit from every man, woman, and child consuming a carbohydrate-based diet. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly cheap to produce. It&amp;rsquo;s highly profitable, and it keeps you perpetually hungry. What could be more perfect? - Pharmaceutical companies are profiting from this. Weight-loss industry&amp;rsquo;s profiting from this. Undertakers are making out like bandits. About the only people that aren&amp;rsquo;t profiting from all of this are the rest of us. Nora went on: Long before we ever came along, grasslands and ruminants co-evolved. Cattle are basically designed to eat one thing and one thing only, fresh green grass. We used to have 40 more species of large herbivores roaming across North America before the end of the last ice age, and we had 60 million bison thundering across the Great Plains. Today we have 60 million cattle that are populating feedlots. You know, grain feeding of animals. [cows mooing] And what do grains do to cattle? They fatten them up. We could take a hint from that. Roughly 97% of all the meat produced today is produced in these feedlots. And where we hear passionate vegetarians and vegans and animal rights advocates screaming about how we raise animals for food, I&amp;rsquo;m standing right there with them. It&amp;rsquo;s wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s unsustainable, and it has to stop. But there&amp;rsquo;s also misinformation and misunderstanding being promoted by genuinely well-meaning people. What people don&amp;rsquo;t understand is that everything really hinges on restoring natural systems. [Robert] Do you see that happening in the United&amp;hellip; Like, can we reclaim our Midwestern prairies again? Is that possible? [Nora] It depends on how successful this documentary is. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lierre Keith author/activist shared:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a vegan. I was never a vegetarian. I went from standard American diet, vegan. I think when I started as a teenager, I had very good impulses about the world that I wanted and the&amp;hellip;ethical base that I wanted to form the actions that were my life, that were going to be my life. That hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed. So justice, and compassion, and anything that questions human hubris or human entitlement&amp;ndash; those are the only values that are gonna get us to the world that we need.
The problem is information, and with a different collection of facts, a different set of information, I might have made a very different decision. If you want to reduce your carbon footprint, one of the best things you can do is eat locally, grow your own food in your own backyard. So I took this up with a fervor. I really wanted to do all this, so I made a garden happen. And pretty immediately hit the wall of&amp;hellip; what do plants eat? We&amp;rsquo;re used to thinking of plants as sort of insensate salads. They actually have needs. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m going to get the organic whatever, and I go to the farm store, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking around, and every single thing that&amp;rsquo;s an amendment that is for fruit like strawberries, it&amp;rsquo;s bone meal and blood meal. Well, where do I think minerals come from? Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t know! I&amp;rsquo;ve never done this before, and I&amp;rsquo;m horrified! I mean, I don&amp;rsquo;t even want to smell it. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to touch it. It feels so unclean. [Robert] And where does this bone meal and blood meal come from? It comes from, you know&amp;ndash; from animals. [laughs] He&amp;rsquo;s like, &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fall out of the sky. I know this is about dead animals! It&amp;rsquo;s horrifying to me. What do I do? I have to supply what the soil needs, and what the soil wants is dead plants and dead animals, and I can&amp;rsquo;t take animals out of that equation. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s absolute hubris to think we can. That&amp;rsquo;s what soil is. That&amp;rsquo;s how it evolved. That&amp;rsquo;s a thriving, living community. There are insects, and they want to eat strawberries, too. So either I&amp;rsquo;m going to kill them or I&amp;rsquo;m going to get some creatures that will do it for me. And I went ahead and got chickens and ducks. [quacking] Again, this was this just tremendous moment of ethical and moral meltdown. So now I&amp;rsquo;m enslaving these chickens and ducks to do this terrible thing for me, which is kill. You&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like a duck eat a slug. You want to see happiness?
&amp;ldquo;This is what I live for,&amp;rdquo; was what my duck said, and, boy, was she a happy little creature. The chickens as well. So they ate all the bugs for me, and I never saw another slug. Animals tell us what they want. You know, if you just let them do what their nature is to do, then they&amp;rsquo;re&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s not even that they are happy, it&amp;rsquo;s that they are who they should be. The most destructive thing we&amp;rsquo;ve done is this activity called agriculture. We don&amp;rsquo;t really have a clue what goes into making that corn or making that soy. All we know is that you look down on your plate, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like a dead thing, therefore, heh, it somehow must be peaceful, and kind, and sustainable. And we&amp;rsquo;re utterly wrong about this.
You take a piece of land and you clear every living thing off it, and I&amp;rsquo;m including the bacteria in that. So all the plants and animals that are supposed to live there, they&amp;rsquo;re gone. Now you&amp;rsquo;re going to grow an acre of corn or wheat.
That corn is going to require things that are not there for it, and you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to come from the outside and apply them. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take a lot of fertilizer, insecticides, and fungicides, &amp;lsquo;cause you&amp;rsquo;re fighting a war. Right?
All those other plants and all those little animals want to come back. Now another thing that happens is every time you plant that corn, you&amp;rsquo;re destroying that soil. A prairie or a grassland, it&amp;rsquo;s the perennial roots that make channels for the rain. When you only have annuals, they don&amp;rsquo;t live a long time, so they don&amp;rsquo;t have time to build long roots, so year-by-year, you are drawing down that soil. And then of course, all that soil washes off. If you&amp;rsquo;re on any kind of a slope, it all is just going to go into the local river, and kill it with all that dirt, so now there&amp;rsquo;s no fish either. In the meantime though, while the corn is still growing, you can transport it to a miserable cow living on a cement floor inside a steel building&amp;hellip; and feed that cow for about 60 days. Past that point, she will die from the corn because it&amp;rsquo;s not her natural diet. But until that point, she will get really fat, really fast. And then slaughter her, feed her to humans, so you&amp;rsquo;re going to make people sick eating this meat as well. As far as I can tell, this is nothing but death and destruction from the very beginning to the very end of this. Now I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through another scenario, which is you take the same acre of land, but you don&amp;rsquo;t hurt it in any way. You let it have its own wisdom, its own impulse toward life, its own wild way. And what you have is a whole bunch of perennial plants growing there.
You have a whole bunch of really sturdy grasses. You&amp;rsquo;ve got big birds, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got ground-dwelling birds. And then you&amp;rsquo;ve got small mammals and larger mammals. You might even have, every once in a while, a really big mammal come across there. You might have a wolf, a bear, or somebody. And in the meantime, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a ruminant. [moos] So you&amp;rsquo;ve produced the same amount of food for people. You&amp;rsquo;ve got the one ruminant at the end. You slaughter her, and now people can eat, but that acre that is still in that prairie, that grassland, you could come back in 10,000 years and all of that life would still be there. The only thing different would be a little more soil, which is to say a little more resilience, a little more depth to life. And that is how we lived for 2.5 million (or if we think in terms of creation about 5850) years as humans on this planet, participating in that cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The thoughts of writer/holistic farmer Joe Salatin are also worth their weight in gold:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re here in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and what we do is pasture livestock. [moos] In nature, herbivores live in large groups and they migrate. All we&amp;rsquo;re doing is duplicating that kind of migration, moving the animals across the land, so that this choreography, this ballet of the pasture can perform its dance on the grass. [Pete Evans] When people say eating this way is unsustainable? [Joe] Oh. Listen, it&amp;rsquo;s not only sustainable, it&amp;rsquo;s actually what we call regenerative. It allows the grass, then, time to regrow, to recuperate. Grass is essentially 95% sunshine. This takes sunbeams and converts it into something that has weight. And amazingly, the herbivore can take this, ferment it in her rumen, and turn this into, arguably, the most nutrient-dense food in the world. Grass grows in what I call an S-curve. If you can see that &amp;lsquo;S&amp;rsquo;. So diaper down here, teenage, rapid growth, and then nursing home out here. What we want to do is keep this forage in this rapid-growth state as much as possible. So the role of the herbivore in nature is actually to prune the grass to restart that rapid metabolic capacity. This is what builds soil, hydrates the landscape, and actually sequesters carbon. This is the system. When grass is allowed to be as productive as it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be, it actually is far more efficient at converting solar energy into biomass than even trees. That&amp;rsquo;s why all the rich, deep soils of the planet are under prairies with herbivores. And if every farm in the world would do this, we would sequester all the carbon that&amp;rsquo;s been emitted since the beginning of the Industrial Age in fewer than 10 years. When a confinement animal facility shows a picture of this hog factory or chicken factory or whatever, they&amp;rsquo;re not showing all the land that&amp;rsquo;s required to grow the grain to keep it going and all the land that&amp;rsquo;s required to handle all the manure that it&amp;rsquo;s generating. In this system, you&amp;rsquo;re seeing all that land. I think a lot of industrial agriculture thinking is that the earth is a reluctant lover. Whereas, actually, we view the earth as an abundant, loving partner who responds to caress, who responds to care, and if we will come humbly to the land, why, it&amp;rsquo;s ready to give us way more than we could have wrestled from it. - [honking] - This is the mystical, awesome cycle of life, and to be able to be this close to it has a humility to it, a perspective&amp;hellip; that is actually quite profound, and actually quite historically normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This documentary is a powerful reminder that there is no such thing as a “magic pill”. We cannot assume that we can reinvent our food or alter it without understanding the long-term effects, all the while expecting to succeed. This principle extends not only to food and health but also to how we treat our entire environment here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this documentary is a must-watch for anyone interested in understanding the true nature of health, the importance of responsible environmental stewardship, and the long-term effects of our choices. It offers invaluable insights that can inspire more conscious living and a healthier planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Yuval Noah Harari (historian) shared a disturbing insight in a captivating podcast on The Diary of a CEO:
“&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans typically learn to manipulate something long before they understand the consequences of their manipulations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; If we examine the external world, particularly our ecological systems, we have learned how to cut down forests and build massive dams long before grasping their implications on those ecosystems, which has contributed to the current ecological crisis. We manipulated the world without understanding the consequences, and something similar could very well happen within our own bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-true-this-rings-for-our-health&#34;&gt;How true this rings for our health!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-hopeful-transformation&#34;&gt;A Hopeful Transformation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to my story. After several years on this new journey of enlightening discovery, I have become much healthier: I’ve reversed my hypertension, insulin resistance, eliminated brain fog, and lost 35 kg of body weight over the span of 8 months. In fact, my weight loss journey is ongoing as I continue to learn about “how the body works,” to quote Dr. Eckberg. I now feel much better, as I understand how to utilize various simple tools to achieve the health outcomes I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-path-to-change&#34;&gt;My Path to Change&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-events-have-led-to-the-result-in-addition-to-the-work-invested&#34;&gt;What events have led to the result in addition to the &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; invested?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to hit rock bottom to catalyze my change. I needed that video from Dr. Eckberg, which struck a particular nerve and ignited my motivation for change. I had to realize that I could not alter my results if I continued the same behaviors that previously led to them, simply hoping for a positive outcome. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember, there is no magic pill.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to educate myself extensively about the biochemistry of the body, nutrition, recent history, and how to differentiate between genuine science and pseudoscience. For instance, it is crucial to grasp the difference between “correlation” and “causation.” Investigate who funds the studies you rely on and consider their possible incentives. Making educated guesses about the ruth is far from impossible, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to distinguish between real food and items merely labeled “food.” As Dr. Lustig states in his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“People think supplements are the antidote for bad food. They’re not. Rather, Real Food is the treatment, while bad food is the poison. Real Food is low in sugar and high in fiber, which lowers insulin levels; it protects the liver and nourishes the gut.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Real food typically has a short shelf life and rarely comes in a package with a label or nutrition facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I needed to understand the significant impact of diets on our health. From my research - initially centered around Keto and Intermittent Fasting - I learned that different diets can serve as tools for specific outcomes. However, any diet can be harmful if it includes unhealthy, ultra-processed products that aren’t considered Real Food. Almost any type of diet can be healthy if it consists of Real Food. Conversely, it holds true that if you consume ultra-processed “food,” regardless of the diet it fits into, it will negatively affect your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-a-little-tip-to-make-things-easier&#34;&gt;Just a little tip to make things easier:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you focus solely on Real Food while practicing intermittent fasting (also known as time-restricted feeding) and occasionally engaging in longer fasts (to promote autophagy - a self-repair state of the body), you will likely experience improved health. This has been my most significant realization so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many more nuances to know about what counts as Real Food and what doesn’t, but I’ll write about that in a future article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-purpose-of-writing-this-article&#34;&gt;The purpose of writing this article:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to share my personal story and a glimpse of what I’ve recently discovered about health - specifically my health - to encourage &lt;strong&gt;YOU&lt;/strong&gt;, the reader, to take this important matter into your own hands. I didn’t spend all my time learning about these topics over the last five years in one go; rather, I learned bit by bit, step by step. This is the approach you should adopt as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless success stories around us, highlighting that those who achieved them did not succumb to the limiting beliefs that certain entities in this world attempt to impose upon them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;may-your-journey-become-one-such-success-story-i-wish-you-all-the-best&#34;&gt;May your journey become one such success story! I wish you all the best!&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Rediscovering Real Food - Transform Your Diet for Lasting Health and Vitality</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/post/realfood/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/en/post/realfood/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an age where convenience often overshadows quality, understanding what constitutes &amp;ldquo;real food&amp;rdquo; is more vital than ever. As we navigate a marketplace flooded with processed and ultra-processed &amp;ldquo;food-like&amp;rdquo; products, distinguishing between nourishing options and those that may be detrimental to our health becomes crucial. This journey transcends mere sustenance; it is about reclaiming our health and vitality amidst a rapidly deteriorating environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will unpack the essence of real food - what it is, which food products to avoid, and why this knowledge is essential for our well-being. Drawing insights from esteemed medical professionals and my personal health journey, I aim to provide a roadmap for transforming your diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My path to wellness began with the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting - a crucial combination in my battle against obesity and sought to reverse my insulin resistance. Through this experience, I recognized the profound impact that our dietary choices have on our bodies. If you’ve seen Dr. Sten Eckberg&amp;rsquo;s enlightening video titled &amp;lsquo;Your Doctor Is Wrong About Insulin Resistance,&amp;rsquo; you may already appreciate the significance of this condition and its broader implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulin resistance - a state in which our cells become less responsive to insulin - highlights the urgency of this discussion. While my experience is unique, the struggle against health deterioration is universal. Today, we live in a society where our diets are increasingly compromised. It is essential to ask ourselves critical questions about our food:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is what I eat nutrient-dense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it affect my biochemistry?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has it been processed, and does that compromise its integrity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing these questions is a crucial first step toward lasting change. Join me as we explore the transformative power of real food and discover how our kitchen creations can rejuvenate both our bodies and minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-food-what-should-we-consume&#34;&gt;Defining Food: What Should We Consume?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/post/realfood/real.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alt text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what real food is, let&amp;rsquo;s refer to an insightful definition provided by Dr. Robert Lustig in one of his interviews. He describes food as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;a substrate that contributes to either the growth or burning of an organism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; This means that food serves a purpose - either as energy or as a contributor to bodily growth. However, fructose, a common sweetener, inhibits this process and is present in 73% of items in the American grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lustig further explains that ultra-processed foods inhibit growth - particularly skeletal and bone growth, which can lead to osteoporosis. Therefore, if a substance does not contribute to growth or energy utilization, can it truly be considered food? We must educate ourselves to recognize that ultra-processed foods are not healthy options, regardless of what the food industry claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/post/realfood/product.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alt text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child asks for a bag of sweets once a week, we can question whether that truly qualifies as food. Few people consume exclusively real foods, so where is the balance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lustig offers a philosophical concept regarding desserts: they should not dominate our meals. If you choose to have a bag of candy for dessert, be mindful that it contains as much sugar as the Froot Loops you had for breakfast, the Chinese chicken salad for lunch, and the chicken teriyaki for dinner. Essentially, you may have consumed four desserts in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue lies not only with the sugar in candy but also with the hidden sugars found in approximately 73% of grocery items, such as tomato sauce and bread. This problem extends to chemicals and processed polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), often misleadingly marketed as “vegetable oils.” These oils are chemically altered and there is nothing good in them. Additionally, numerous compounds act as preservatives, emulsifiers, and more; however, none support burning or growth in our metabolism. They act as dose-dependent toxins and merely extend the shelf life of these so-called &amp;ldquo;foods,&amp;rdquo; making their taste and texture more desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote Dr. Lustig: &amp;ldquo;Real Food is low in sugar and high in fiber, which lowers insulin levels; it protects the liver and nourishes the gut.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we accept this as a health-determining fact, we can assert that many substances on this Earth, in a pure metabolic sense, are not food for us - even if we do not die immediately after ingesting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some items we could do better without:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar (Sucrose):&lt;/strong&gt; Composed of 50% fructose and 50% glucose, where fructose - metabolized exclusively by the liver - can overwhelm it when consumed excessively and without proper fiber as in whole fruits for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol (Ethanol):&lt;/strong&gt; Just as poisonous as fructose, it is metabolized solely by the liver, which can lead to damage and an inability to perform its other vital metabolic functions. Liverdamage, fatty liver can be the result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in coffee, tea, and many sodas, caffeine is safe in moderation but can lead to toxicity and even death in excessive amounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead and Heavy Metals:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in some contaminated food products due to industrial contamination, these pose severe risks to health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brief-overview-of-essential-nutrients&#34;&gt;A Brief Overview of Essential Nutrients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;macronutrients&#34;&gt;Macronutrients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These nutrients provide energy and are required in larger amounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbohydrates:&lt;/strong&gt; Often referred to as the body&amp;rsquo;s primary energy source, I have come to question the accuracy of this claim since embarking on my health journey. While carbohydrates hold an important place in our nutrition, their significance may be overstated. Some medical professionals and scientists recently stated, based on new evidence, that there is no essential carbohydrate, meaning we do not have to rely heavily on them to be healthy. Unlike essential amino acids and essential fatty acids, carbohydrates are not classified as essential nutrients because the body can produce glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis, primarily from amino acids and glycerol. Many health authorities and scientific studies support the idea that a well-formulated low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet can be healthful and sustainable for some individuals, challenging the traditional emphasis on high carbohydrate intake. However, this does not mean carbohydrates are inherently harmful or unnecessary for everyone; their role can vary depending on individual health status, activity level, and dietary preferences. They are found in grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Without them, we would likely starve our microbiome, which is essential for our health. However, not all carbohydrates are created equal; it is advisable to choose those with a low insulin index for better health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proteins:&lt;/strong&gt; Essential for building and repairing tissues, producing enzymes and hormones, and supporting immune function. Quality sources include meat, fish, dairy, legumes, and certain nuts. However, some grains can cause allergies, and poorly raised or highly processed animal products can contribute to health issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fats:&lt;/strong&gt; Important for energy storage, hormone production, and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Sources include oils, butter, avocados, nuts, and fatty fish, but again, not all are beneficial; for instance, chemically processed vegetable oils, such as PUFAs, can be inflammatory and harmful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;micronutrients&#34;&gt;Micronutrients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While needed in smaller amounts, these nutrients are essential for various bodily functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamins:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic compounds that support various bodily functions, immune health, and metabolism, including Vitamin A, B vitamins, C, D, E, and K.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minerals:&lt;/strong&gt; Inorganic elements playing key roles in functions like bone health and muscle function, including calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, zinc, sodium, and phosphorus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;water&#34;&gt;Water&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essential for hydration, digestion, nutrient transport, temperature regulation, and metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fiber&#34;&gt;Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though not classified as a nutrient since it isn&amp;rsquo;t digested, dietary fiber is crucial for digestive health and can help reduce the risk of various chronic diseases. It supports our gut microbiome - a symbiotic relationship that is fundamental to overall health. Scientists are beginning to recognize the microbiome as a new &amp;ldquo;gold&amp;rdquo; for restoring health if properly regenerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a balanced diet - including a variety of &lt;strong&gt;real foods from all these categories&lt;/strong&gt; - is vital for good health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-choose-the-proper-real-foods&#34;&gt;How to Choose the Proper &amp;ldquo;Real Foods&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/post/realfood/grocery.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alt text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NOVA classification system is a food classification tool based on the level of processing that food items undergo. Developed by researchers at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, NOVA categorizes foods into four groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed or minimally processed foods:&lt;/strong&gt; These are natural foods that have been modified only in ways that do not change their basic properties. Examples include fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, meats, and milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed culinary ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; These are substances extracted from the first group or from nature, processed for use in cooking, such as oils, butter, sugar, and salt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed foods:&lt;/strong&gt; These are foods that have been manufactured by adding ingredients from the second group to the first. Examples include canned vegetables with added salt, cheeses, and bread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed food and drink products:&lt;/strong&gt; This category includes industrial formulations made mostly or entirely from substances such as sugars, oils, fats, starch, and proteins, along with additives, preservatives, and artificial flavors or colors. Examples include sugary drinks, packaged snacks, instant noodles, and pre-prepared meals.
The NOVA system is often used in nutrition research and public health to understand dietary patterns and their impact on health, as well as to guide consumers in making healthier food choices by highlighting the degree of food processing.
The NOVA classification system categorizes food based on the extent and purpose of their processing. It can be a useful tool for making healthier food choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heres-how-you-can-use-the-nova-system-to-guide-your-food-selection&#34;&gt;Here’s how you can use the NOVA system to guide your food selection:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the NOVA Categories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed or Minimally Processed Foods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: Fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, eggs, meat, milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Focus on these foods as they provide the most nutrients and are generally healthier. Try to fill your diet with whole, natural foods without added ingredients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed Culinary Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: Oils, butter, sugar, and salt that are used in cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Use these sparingly. They can enhance the flavor of whole foods, but high amounts can lead to excessive calorie intake and unhealthy eating patterns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed Foods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: Canned vegetables with added salt, cheese, bread, and simple sweets (like jams).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Choose options with fewer additives and preservatives. Look for products with less added sugar and salt, and more recognizable ingredients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed Foods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: Sugary drinks, packaged snacks, instant noodles, ready-to-eat meals, and processed meats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Limit these foods as they often contain harmful additives, high levels of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. They can be calorie-dense and low in nutritional value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for Using the NOVA System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grocery Shopping:&lt;/strong&gt; When shopping, prioritize the perimeter of the store where fresh produce, meats, and dairy products are usually found. Avoid the center aisles filled with ultra-processed foods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Labels:&lt;/strong&gt; If you do choose packaged foods, read ingredient labels carefully. Fewer ingredients and recognizable food items usually indicate less processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking at Home:&lt;/strong&gt; Preparing meals at home allows control over the ingredients being used and reduces reliance on ultra-processed convenience foods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meal Planning:&lt;/strong&gt; Plan meals around whole foods, incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein sources, and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindful Eating:&lt;/strong&gt; Be aware of how much ultra-processed food you consume. Making gradual changes can lead to healthier habits over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thought:&lt;/strong&gt;
By utilizing the NOVA classification system, you can become more conscious of your food choices and prioritize nutritious, less processed options in your diet, ultimately leading to better health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;further-insights&#34;&gt;Further Insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans excel at manipulation but often fail to understand the full consequences of their actions, as Prof. Yuval Noah Harari noted. This tendency prompts a need for caution, a reminder to check the potential dire consequences of our choices. Understanding how our bodies work, particularly regarding the hormonal system and distinct pathways that lead to behaviors affecting our health, is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find great value in the teachings of experts like Dr. Robert Lustig, Dr. Pradip Jamnadas, Dr. Andrew Huberman, and Prof. Anna Lembke. Their insights into how food influences gene expression (epigenetics), hormonal pathways, gut microbiome health, and neurological functions highlight that dietary choices can be direct causes of mental health issues, neurological diseases like Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s and many others, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular conditions. In many ways, we might be termed a “Dopamine Nation,” where our neural pathways are hijacked by addictive behaviors. Chronic stress, compounded by poor food choices, impacts our sleep and overall wellness. Thus, understanding nutrition and its relationship with our environment is paramount for making wiser health decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to have mastered all facets of this knowledge, but I strive to learn and share what I have discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to consuming real foods, we must understand how our food is altered in ways detrimental to our health. Differentiating real food from food-like products is essential.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-balanced-keto-glucogenic-lifestyle-is-recommended&#34;&gt;A balanced &amp;ldquo;keto-glucogenic lifestyle&amp;rdquo; is recommended&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to grasp the importance of &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; eating continuously. Metabolically, entering the state of ketosis allows the body to utilize fat as fuel. Burning fat, especially abdominal fat, is only effective in ketosis, which can be achieved by intermittent fasting or a low-carbohydrate, possibly ketogenic, diet. Our ancestors did not have access to 24/7 grocery stores, which meant periods of feasting and famine. Our bodies are designed to endure longer periods without energy. Moreover, fasting activates autophagy, a process that repairs our bodies but will not occur if we are constantly well-fed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance between ketosis and glucose metabolism is very important in maintaining our health. It is not necessarily the choice of diet or nutrition that is most helpful. What does seem certain is that different diets can be effective for different conditions, and this is largely determined by the health conditions of the people taking them. How much we know about our own body&amp;rsquo;s biochemistry can be a determining factor in choosing the right diet and foods for ourselves. Based on what I have learned, it is definitely helpful to aim for a low-carbohydrate diet, with intermittent fasting and occasional extended fasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good to avoid:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refined grain products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vegetables and fruits with high starch content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chemically processed vegetable oils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sugar and fructose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;processed meat products and meat products preserved with various chemicals, as well as meat products derived from inappropriate animal husbandry, i.e. not from the natural rearing of animals, and GMO products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low-fat and flavoured dairy products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of these, consume as much as possible:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;healthy fats such as butter, tallow, other animal fats, coconut oil, olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regular green leafy, colourful, cruciferous vegetables and seasonal fruits in moderation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;naturally reared meat, fish, eggs, innards, which are excellent sources of protein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in moderation, full-fat fermented dairy products, various cheeses, cottage cheese, sour cream, preferably from naturally reared animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook, bake, prepare at home if possible, using ingredients that you know are real food.&lt;/strong&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many modern food processing procedures, such as using high heat on vegetable oils and combining sugar with proteins, produce harmful compounds known as Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs). These compounds, while palatable, can accelerate the internal aging process (similar to rusting) and lead to various health issues. Dr. Pradip Jamnadas&amp;rsquo;s clear lecture on this topic opened my eyes to the necessity of relearning proper food processing techniques, making it vital to protect the healthy foods we work hard to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous dedicated individuals dedicated to promoting our collective well-being and educating us about health. They help us recognize that we can make a difference through informed choices. Their lectures on platforms like YouTube are free, providing invaluable insights. Personally, I appreciate their efforts and aspire to raise awareness to benefit many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while it is certainly not easy to navigate this rather difficult landscape, and aquiring reliable data or knowledge, the reality is, that no effort on your side will be in vain. Because if you think about it for a brief moment, what do you have to loose? The answer is: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;You can only gain a better nutrition, better health, and a happier life.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; So do not focus on what you can loose, yes, a little time for research. As stated in Ecclesiastes 11:4 of the Bible, &amp;lsquo;The one who watches the wind will not sow seed, and the one who looks at the clouds will not reap.&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Therefore, sow diligently and reap the benefits of your invested work and efforts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-use-autophagy-and-fasting-the-goal-is-not-merely-fasting-alone-rather-it-is-to-trigger-autophagy-through-fasting&#34;&gt;Why use autophagy and fasting? The goal is not merely fasting alone; rather, it is to trigger autophagy through fasting.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting and reaching autophagy can offer a variety of benefits from both health and economic perspectives. Here are some of the key advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;health-benefits&#34;&gt;Health Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular Repair and Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt;: Autophagy helps remove damaged cells and proteins, promoting cellular health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight Management&lt;/strong&gt;: Fasting can aid in weight loss and fat burning, reducing obesity-related health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Metabolic Health&lt;/strong&gt;: Fasting can enhance insulin sensitivity, lower blood sugar levels, and improve overall metabolic function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;: Fasting has been shown to decrease markers of inflammation, which is linked to various chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Mental Clarity&lt;/strong&gt;: Some people report improved focus and mental clarity during fasting periods, possibly due to increased production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Longevity Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: Studies suggest that fasting and autophagy may contribute to increased lifespan by promoting cellular repair and reducing age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Heart Health&lt;/strong&gt;: Fasting can help reduce cholesterol levels and blood pressure, leading to better cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosted Immune Function&lt;/strong&gt;: Fasting may enhance immune response and promote the regeneration of immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;economic-benefits&#34;&gt;Economic Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Food Costs&lt;/strong&gt;: Fasting reduces the number of meals you need to purchase, which can lead to significant savings on grocery bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Healthcare Costs&lt;/strong&gt;: By improving health metrics and reducing the risk of chronic diseases, fasting can lead to lower medical expenses over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Productivity&lt;/strong&gt;: Enhanced mental clarity and energy from fasting can improve work performance, potentially leading to better job outcomes and income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Savings&lt;/strong&gt;: Fasting simplifies meal planning and preparation, freeing up time that can be spent on other productive activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less Dependency on Supplements&lt;/strong&gt;: The health benefits associated with fasting may reduce the need for dietary supplements, leading to additional financial savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowered Eating Out Costs&lt;/strong&gt;: With fewer meals to prepare or purchase, there&amp;rsquo;s a potential decrease in spending on dining out or takeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplicity in Diet Choices&lt;/strong&gt;: Fasting can simplify dietary choices, reducing the time and money spent on selecting various foods and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting and reaching autophagy can provide numerous health benefits while also being economically advantageous. By promoting better health, reducing food costs, and increasing productivity, fasting offers a compelling case for individuals looking to improve their overall well-being while managing their finances effectively. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any fasting regimen, especially for those with existing health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heres-a-text-summary-of-the-video-i-wanted-to-share-with-you-just-because-it-is-so-important-and-many-people-simply-do-not-know-about-this&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a text summary of the video I wanted to share with you, just because it is so important and many people simply do not know about this:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the power to heal yourself without relying on money or time. We can end chronic disease, strengthen immunity, and achieve metabolic fitness for the first time. This is our path out of chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Mindy Pelz&lt;/strong&gt;, a top nutrition and functional health expert and best-selling author. She is a recognized leader in the Alternative Health field and a pioneer in the fasting movement. In this video, we distill the essence of her teachings and highlight the top six foods she consumes to promote effective autophagy, seamlessly fitting within her fasting regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-concept-of-self-healing&#34;&gt;The Concept of Self-Healing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, nobody cures you; you cure yourself. It’s essential to view the human body as a self-healing organism, constantly figuring out how to keep you alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-autophagy&#34;&gt;What is Autophagy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s understand what autophagy is. Autophagy occurs when cells recognize that nutrients and blood sugar (glucose) are not entering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: The cell assesses its situation and thinks, &amp;ldquo;Huh, nothing&amp;rsquo;s coming in? We need to improve ourselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elimination of Harmful Cells&lt;/strong&gt;: It pushes out viruses and bacteria. If a cell is becoming cancerous or aging rapidly (often referred to as a &amp;ldquo;zombie cell&amp;rdquo;), it identifies that cell as a liability and eliminates it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/post/autophagy/virus.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alt text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is a natural cellular process in which cells degrade and recycle their own components. The term comes from Greek words: “Auto” (self) and “Phagy” (eating). Essentially, autophagy is the body’s method of cleaning out damaged cells to regenerate newer, healthier ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For autophagy to take place, the body must be in a &lt;strong&gt;fasted state&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-fasted-state&#34;&gt;What is a Fasted State?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fasted state occurs when blood sugar levels drop sufficiently, triggering a metabolic switch from glucose metabolism to ketogenic (fat-burning) metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing and Effects&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Hours&lt;/strong&gt;: The body begins to make the switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 Hours&lt;/strong&gt;: Ketone production starts, leading to mental clarity. Hunger hormones are turned off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 Hours&lt;/strong&gt;: Growth hormone levels rise, slowing the aging process and helping burn fat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 Hours&lt;/strong&gt;: Significant testosterone increase (up to 1300% in men) and decreasing inflammation markers (CRP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 Hours&lt;/strong&gt;: Autophagy is stimulated, repairing cells and eliminating aging ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 Hours&lt;/strong&gt;: The gut resets, and intestinal stem cells repair the gut lining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 Hours&lt;/strong&gt;: The body starts burning stubborn belly fat for energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48 Hours&lt;/strong&gt;: New dopamine receptor sites are created to motivate the search for food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;72 Hours&lt;/strong&gt;: The immune system reboots itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process occurs naturally, without the need for drugs or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-can-i-do-fasting&#34;&gt;How Can I Do Fasting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you fast for 72 hours regularly? The answer is no. Here are some guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-Day Water Fast&lt;/strong&gt;: Twice a year to eliminate rogue cells potentially leading to tumors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48-Hour Fast&lt;/strong&gt;: Once a quarter, beneficial for mental health challenges like depression and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36-Hour Fast&lt;/strong&gt;: Once a month for those struggling with weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24-Hour Fast&lt;/strong&gt;: Once a week can be miraculous; this is often referred to as &amp;ldquo;one meal a day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people should typically fast between 12 to 17 hours regularly, except women during the week before their menstrual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When fasting, it’s crucial to be mindful of food choices. Here are the &lt;strong&gt;top six foods&lt;/strong&gt; that Dr. Mindy frequently consumes to maximize the benefits of fasting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;top-six-foods-to-maximize-fasting-benefits&#34;&gt;Top Six Foods to Maximize Fasting Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avocado&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great for breaking a fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking a fast with fat kills the hunger hormone and reduces subsequent cravings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often paired with probiotic foods like sauerkraut and kimchi for added benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacao&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A source of chocolate that stimulates autophagy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for clean cacao sources, with the first ingredient being cacao and the second ingredient cacao butter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark chocolate is preferable for higher cacao content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases autophagy in liver, muscle, and heart tissue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose organic, mold-free coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black coffee is generally acceptable during fasting; adding MCT oil may enhance fat-burning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Tea&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great alternative to coffee for those seeking less stimulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stimulates autophagy in various cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bergamot tea has also been shown to induce autophagy in cancer cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olive Oil&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure it’s organic and not rancid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid heating, as it can turn into an inflammatory fat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has beneficial effects on Alzheimer’s-related proteins and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curcumin&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The active component in turmeric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be consumed in various forms, such as sprinkled on food or juiced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research indicates it increases autophagy and inhibits disease proliferation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-1&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Dr. Mindy Pelz, it’s essential to establish a long-term strategy to stimulate autophagy. If you neglect this, your cells will accumulate toxins, hindering your health. Embrace this knowledge and start your journey toward self-healing today!&lt;/p&gt;
