      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an age where convenience often overshadows quality, understanding what constitutes &amp;ldquo;real food&amp;rdquo; is more vital than ever. As we navigate a marketplace flooded with processed and ultra-processed &amp;ldquo;food-like&amp;rdquo; products, distinguishing between nourishing options and those that may be detrimental to our health becomes crucial. This journey transcends mere sustenance; it is about reclaiming our health and vitality amidst a rapidly deteriorating environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will unpack the essence of real food - what it is, which food products to avoid, and why this knowledge is essential for our well-being. Drawing insights from esteemed medical professionals and my personal health journey, I aim to provide a roadmap for transforming your diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My path to wellness began with the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting - a crucial combination in my battle against obesity and sought to reverse my insulin resistance. Through this experience, I recognized the profound impact that our dietary choices have on our bodies. If you’ve seen Dr. Sten Eckberg&amp;rsquo;s enlightening video titled &amp;lsquo;Your Doctor Is Wrong About Insulin Resistance,&amp;rsquo; you may already appreciate the significance of this condition and its broader implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulin resistance - a state in which our cells become less responsive to insulin - highlights the urgency of this discussion. While my experience is unique, the struggle against health deterioration is universal. Today, we live in a society where our diets are increasingly compromised. It is essential to ask ourselves critical questions about our food:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is what I eat nutrient-dense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it affect my biochemistry?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has it been processed, and does that compromise its integrity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing these questions is a crucial first step toward lasting change. Join me as we explore the transformative power of real food and discover how our kitchen creations can rejuvenate both our bodies and minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-food-what-should-we-consume&#34;&gt;Defining Food: What Should We Consume?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/en/post/realfood/real.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alt text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what real food is, let&amp;rsquo;s refer to an insightful definition provided by Dr. Robert Lustig in one of his interviews. He describes food as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;a substrate that contributes to either the growth or burning of an organism.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; This means that food serves a purpose - either as energy or as a contributor to bodily growth. However, fructose, a common sweetener, inhibits this process and is present in 73% of items in the American grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lustig further explains that ultra-processed foods inhibit growth - particularly skeletal and bone growth, which can lead to osteoporosis. Therefore, if a substance does not contribute to growth or energy utilization, can it truly be considered food? We must educate ourselves to recognize that ultra-processed foods are not healthy options, regardless of what the food industry claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/en/post/realfood/product.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alt text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child asks for a bag of sweets once a week, we can question whether that truly qualifies as food. Few people consume exclusively real foods, so where is the balance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lustig offers a philosophical concept regarding desserts: they should not dominate our meals. If you choose to have a bag of candy for dessert, be mindful that it contains as much sugar as the Froot Loops you had for breakfast, the Chinese chicken salad for lunch, and the chicken teriyaki for dinner. Essentially, you may have consumed four desserts in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue lies not only with the sugar in candy but also with the hidden sugars found in approximately 73% of grocery items, such as tomato sauce and bread. This problem extends to chemicals and processed polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), often misleadingly marketed as “vegetable oils.” These oils are chemically altered and there is nothing good in them. Additionally, numerous compounds act as preservatives, emulsifiers, and more; however, none support burning or growth in our metabolism. They act as dose-dependent toxins and merely extend the shelf life of these so-called &amp;ldquo;foods,&amp;rdquo; making their taste and texture more desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote Dr. Lustig: &amp;ldquo;Real Food is low in sugar and high in fiber, which lowers insulin levels; it protects the liver and nourishes the gut.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we accept this as a health-determining fact, we can assert that many substances on this Earth, in a pure metabolic sense, are not food for us - even if we do not die immediately after ingesting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some items we could do better without:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar (Sucrose):&lt;/strong&gt; Composed of 50% fructose and 50% glucose, where fructose - metabolized exclusively by the liver - can overwhelm it when consumed excessively and without proper fiber as in whole fruits for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol (Ethanol):&lt;/strong&gt; Just as poisonous as fructose, it is metabolized solely by the liver, which can lead to damage and an inability to perform its other vital metabolic functions. Liverdamage, fatty liver can be the result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in coffee, tea, and many sodas, caffeine is safe in moderation but can lead to toxicity and even death in excessive amounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead and Heavy Metals:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in some contaminated food products due to industrial contamination, these pose severe risks to health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brief-overview-of-essential-nutrients&#34;&gt;A Brief Overview of Essential Nutrients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;macronutrients&#34;&gt;Macronutrients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These nutrients provide energy and are required in larger amounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbohydrates:&lt;/strong&gt; Often referred to as the body&amp;rsquo;s primary energy source, I have come to question the accuracy of this claim since embarking on my health journey. While carbohydrates hold an important place in our nutrition, their significance may be overstated. Some medical professionals and scientists recently stated, based on new evidence, that there is no essential carbohydrate, meaning we do not have to rely heavily on them to be healthy. Unlike essential amino acids and essential fatty acids, carbohydrates are not classified as essential nutrients because the body can produce glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis, primarily from amino acids and glycerol. Many health authorities and scientific studies support the idea that a well-formulated low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet can be healthful and sustainable for some individuals, challenging the traditional emphasis on high carbohydrate intake. However, this does not mean carbohydrates are inherently harmful or unnecessary for everyone; their role can vary depending on individual health status, activity level, and dietary preferences. They are found in grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Without them, we would likely starve our microbiome, which is essential for our health. However, not all carbohydrates are created equal; it is advisable to choose those with a low insulin index for better health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proteins:&lt;/strong&gt; Essential for building and repairing tissues, producing enzymes and hormones, and supporting immune function. Quality sources include meat, fish, dairy, legumes, and certain nuts. However, some grains can cause allergies, and poorly raised or highly processed animal products can contribute to health issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fats:&lt;/strong&gt; Important for energy storage, hormone production, and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Sources include oils, butter, avocados, nuts, and fatty fish, but again, not all are beneficial; for instance, chemically processed vegetable oils, such as PUFAs, can be inflammatory and harmful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;micronutrients&#34;&gt;Micronutrients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While needed in smaller amounts, these nutrients are essential for various bodily functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamins:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic compounds that support various bodily functions, immune health, and metabolism, including Vitamin A, B vitamins, C, D, E, and K.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minerals:&lt;/strong&gt; Inorganic elements playing key roles in functions like bone health and muscle function, including calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, zinc, sodium, and phosphorus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;water&#34;&gt;Water&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essential for hydration, digestion, nutrient transport, temperature regulation, and metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fiber&#34;&gt;Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though not classified as a nutrient since it isn&amp;rsquo;t digested, dietary fiber is crucial for digestive health and can help reduce the risk of various chronic diseases. It supports our gut microbiome - a symbiotic relationship that is fundamental to overall health. Scientists are beginning to recognize the microbiome as a new &amp;ldquo;gold&amp;rdquo; for restoring health if properly regenerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a balanced diet - including a variety of &lt;strong&gt;real foods from all these categories&lt;/strong&gt; - is vital for good health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-choose-the-proper-real-foods&#34;&gt;How to Choose the Proper &amp;ldquo;Real Foods&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/en/post/realfood/grocery.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alt text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NOVA classification system is a food classification tool based on the level of processing that food items undergo. Developed by researchers at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, NOVA categorizes foods into four groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed or minimally processed foods:&lt;/strong&gt; These are natural foods that have been modified only in ways that do not change their basic properties. Examples include fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, meats, and milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed culinary ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; These are substances extracted from the first group or from nature, processed for use in cooking, such as oils, butter, sugar, and salt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed foods:&lt;/strong&gt; These are foods that have been manufactured by adding ingredients from the second group to the first. Examples include canned vegetables with added salt, cheeses, and bread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed food and drink products:&lt;/strong&gt; This category includes industrial formulations made mostly or entirely from substances such as sugars, oils, fats, starch, and proteins, along with additives, preservatives, and artificial flavors or colors. Examples include sugary drinks, packaged snacks, instant noodles, and pre-prepared meals.
The NOVA system is often used in nutrition research and public health to understand dietary patterns and their impact on health, as well as to guide consumers in making healthier food choices by highlighting the degree of food processing.
The NOVA classification system categorizes food based on the extent and purpose of their processing. It can be a useful tool for making healthier food choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heres-how-you-can-use-the-nova-system-to-guide-your-food-selection&#34;&gt;Here’s how you can use the NOVA system to guide your food selection:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the NOVA Categories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed or Minimally Processed Foods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: Fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, eggs, meat, milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Focus on these foods as they provide the most nutrients and are generally healthier. Try to fill your diet with whole, natural foods without added ingredients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed Culinary Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: Oils, butter, sugar, and salt that are used in cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Use these sparingly. They can enhance the flavor of whole foods, but high amounts can lead to excessive calorie intake and unhealthy eating patterns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed Foods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: Canned vegetables with added salt, cheese, bread, and simple sweets (like jams).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Choose options with fewer additives and preservatives. Look for products with less added sugar and salt, and more recognizable ingredients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed Foods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: Sugary drinks, packaged snacks, instant noodles, ready-to-eat meals, and processed meats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Limit these foods as they often contain harmful additives, high levels of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. They can be calorie-dense and low in nutritional value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for Using the NOVA System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grocery Shopping:&lt;/strong&gt; When shopping, prioritize the perimeter of the store where fresh produce, meats, and dairy products are usually found. Avoid the center aisles filled with ultra-processed foods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Labels:&lt;/strong&gt; If you do choose packaged foods, read ingredient labels carefully. Fewer ingredients and recognizable food items usually indicate less processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking at Home:&lt;/strong&gt; Preparing meals at home allows control over the ingredients being used and reduces reliance on ultra-processed convenience foods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meal Planning:&lt;/strong&gt; Plan meals around whole foods, incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein sources, and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindful Eating:&lt;/strong&gt; Be aware of how much ultra-processed food you consume. Making gradual changes can lead to healthier habits over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thought:&lt;/strong&gt;
By utilizing the NOVA classification system, you can become more conscious of your food choices and prioritize nutritious, less processed options in your diet, ultimately leading to better health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;further-insights&#34;&gt;Further Insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans excel at manipulation but often fail to understand the full consequences of their actions, as Prof. Yuval Noah Harari noted. This tendency prompts a need for caution, a reminder to check the potential dire consequences of our choices. Understanding how our bodies work, particularly regarding the hormonal system and distinct pathways that lead to behaviors affecting our health, is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find great value in the teachings of experts like Dr. Robert Lustig, Dr. Pradip Jamnadas, Dr. Andrew Huberman, and Prof. Anna Lembke. Their insights into how food influences gene expression (epigenetics), hormonal pathways, gut microbiome health, and neurological functions highlight that dietary choices can be direct causes of mental health issues, neurological diseases like Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s and many others, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular conditions. In many ways, we might be termed a “Dopamine Nation,” where our neural pathways are hijacked by addictive behaviors. Chronic stress, compounded by poor food choices, impacts our sleep and overall wellness. Thus, understanding nutrition and its relationship with our environment is paramount for making wiser health decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to have mastered all facets of this knowledge, but I strive to learn and share what I have discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to consuming real foods, we must understand how our food is altered in ways detrimental to our health. Differentiating real food from food-like products is essential.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-balanced-keto-glucogenic-lifestyle-is-recommended&#34;&gt;A balanced &amp;ldquo;keto-glucogenic lifestyle&amp;rdquo; is recommended&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to grasp the importance of &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; eating continuously. Metabolically, entering the state of ketosis allows the body to utilize fat as fuel. Burning fat, especially abdominal fat, is only effective in ketosis, which can be achieved by intermittent fasting or a low-carbohydrate, possibly ketogenic, diet. Our ancestors did not have access to 24/7 grocery stores, which meant periods of feasting and famine. Our bodies are designed to endure longer periods without energy. Moreover, fasting activates autophagy, a process that repairs our bodies but will not occur if we are constantly well-fed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance between ketosis and glucose metabolism is very important in maintaining our health. It is not necessarily the choice of diet or nutrition that is most helpful. What does seem certain is that different diets can be effective for different conditions, and this is largely determined by the health conditions of the people taking them. How much we know about our own body&amp;rsquo;s biochemistry can be a determining factor in choosing the right diet and foods for ourselves. Based on what I have learned, it is definitely helpful to aim for a low-carbohydrate diet, with intermittent fasting and occasional extended fasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good to avoid:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refined grain products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vegetables and fruits with high starch content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chemically processed vegetable oils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sugar and fructose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;processed meat products and meat products preserved with various chemicals, as well as meat products derived from inappropriate animal husbandry, i.e. not from the natural rearing of animals, and GMO products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low-fat and flavoured dairy products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of these, consume as much as possible:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;healthy fats such as butter, tallow, other animal fats, coconut oil, olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regular green leafy, colourful, cruciferous vegetables and seasonal fruits in moderation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;naturally reared meat, fish, eggs, innards, which are excellent sources of protein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in moderation, full-fat fermented dairy products, various cheeses, cottage cheese, sour cream, preferably from naturally reared animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook, bake, prepare at home if possible, using ingredients that you know are real food.&lt;/strong&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/en/post/realfood/home.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alt text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many modern food processing procedures, such as using high heat on vegetable oils and combining sugar with proteins, produce harmful compounds known as Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs). These compounds, while palatable, can accelerate the internal aging process (similar to rusting) and lead to various health issues. Dr. Pradip Jamnadas&amp;rsquo;s clear lecture on this topic opened my eyes to the necessity of relearning proper food processing techniques, making it vital to protect the healthy foods we work hard to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/en/post/realfood/barbecue.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Alt text&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;keep-on-learning-never-stop&#34;&gt;Keep on learning, never stop!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous dedicated individuals dedicated to promoting our collective well-being and educating us about health. They help us recognize that we can make a difference through informed choices. Their lectures on platforms like YouTube are free, providing invaluable insights. Personally, I appreciate their efforts and aspire to raise awareness to benefit many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while it is certainly not easy to navigate this rather difficult landscape, and aquiring reliable data or knowledge, the reality is, that no effort on your side will be in vain. Because if you think about it for a brief moment, what do you have to loose? The answer is: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;You can only gain a better nutrition, better health, and a happier life.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; So do not focus on what you can loose, yes, a little time for research. As stated in Ecclesiastes 11:4 of the Bible, &amp;lsquo;The one who watches the wind will not sow seed, and the one who looks at the clouds will not reap.&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Therefore, sow diligently and reap the benefits of your invested work and efforts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
